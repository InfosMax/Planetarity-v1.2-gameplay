# Space Shooter gameplay

This is a planetary artillery arcade in pseudo 2D (i.e. 2D game in the 3D world).

The player is controling a planet, rotating around Sun. A planet can launch different rockets, rockets

obey gravity (of other planets and Sun). On collision, rocket disappears, on 

collision with a planet - does damage. 

Was created a singleplayer game mode with AI players (random number from 

configurable min/max values). 


Rest of features:

• Planets are visually different (and random) 

• Implemented 4 types of rockets with different base stats (acceleration, weight, 

cooldown, etc.), which are distributed randomly amongst planets 

• Pause/resume feature 

• UI: main menu, HUD, planet HUD (HP bar, shooting cooldown) 


Press "P" to pause the game. (Also "Escape" for main menu)
