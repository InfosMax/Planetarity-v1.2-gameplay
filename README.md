# Planetarity-v1.2-gameplay
Planetarity v1.2  gameplay for Ubisoft :)  

This is a planetary artillery arcade in pseudo 2D (i.e. 2D game in the 3D world).

The player is in control of a planet, rotating around Sun. A planet can shoot rockets, rockets 
obey gravity (of Sun and of other planets). On collision with Sun, rocket disappears, on 
collision with a planet - does damage. 
You need to create a singleplayer game mode with AI players (random number from 
configurable min/max values). 
Rest of features:
• Planets should be visually different (and random) 
• Implement 3 types of rockets with different base stats (acceleration, weight, 
cooldown, etc.), which are distributed randomly amongst planets 
• Pause/resume feature 
• Save/load feature 
• UI: main menu, HUD, planet HUD (HP bar, shooting cooldown) 

Press "P" to pause the game.

Not implemented: 
• Save/load feature 
• UI: main menu
• planet HUD
Reason: lack of time.

Project creator's full name: Lityuga Maksim Anatolievich.
